## What and why

<!-- One paragraph: the problem, and how this change solves it. Link the issue. -->

## How it was verified

- [ ] `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test`
- [ ] `make test-integration` (if API, database, jobs, provider, billing or mail code changed)
- [ ] `make up && make demo`, then the flow tried in the app or the console (if a user flow changed)
- [ ] `make tf-validate tf-lint tf-security` (if Terraform changed)

## Checklist

- [ ] Docs updated (`docs/`, the configuration reference) for any behavior or config change
- [ ] New migration instead of editing an applied one
- [ ] Every tenant-scoped query filters by `tenant_id`, covered by a test that a second tenant cannot see or change the record
- [ ] Operator routes stay behind the operator JWT; tenant admin routes behind the tenant JWT and its permission checks; learner routes resolve the tenant from the host
- [ ] Tenant-supplied credentials are stored only encrypted (CREDENTIALS_ENCRYPTION_KEY) and never reach a log line or an API response
- [ ] Provider webhooks verify their signature or token before doing anything
- [ ] A new provider call works against the local stubs (apps/stubs) or an offline mode, so `make up` and the tests need no account
- [ ] Feature gates read entitlements (never plans); a missing entitlement row denies
- [ ] No secrets, account ids, real emails or hostnames (`make sanitize` is clean)
- [ ] Security-relevant change? Described the threat and mitigation above
