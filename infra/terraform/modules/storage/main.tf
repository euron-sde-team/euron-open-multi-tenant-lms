# The assets bucket (AWS_S3_BUCKET): course and page media, book files, lecture
# resources, assignment submissions, certificates, imports and exports. Private,
# encrypted with the deployment key, versioned, TLS only, every form of public access
# blocked. The APIs read and write it with their task roles and hand browsers
# short-lived presigned URLs, so the bucket carries a CORS rule for the app origins.
#
# Public media (thumbnails, page images) lives under public_read_prefix: when
# cloudfront_distribution_arn is set, that distribution (the cdn module, through Origin
# Access Control) may read that prefix and nothing else.
